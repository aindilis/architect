# have some record of how to solve some particular problem, that is like code isn't it.

For instance,

how do I package a codebase

How do I convert a script to a module
    Depends: codemonkey
    'codemonkey --convert-to-oo <script>'

The outline should be



RequirementManager

Each capability request or requirement may be satisfied by an internal
codebase that has that as an implemented feature or a packaged piece
of software that has that as a capability.

This satisfaction should represent the capabilities of the system.
Should be able to ask for capabilities and what implements them.

Information of how to use it might also be stored.

Capability descriptions describe some system that satisfies some
formal requirements.  To what extent and in what way a given system
purportly satisfies a capability should be recorded with association
to test data.




Iterate over goals and mark which ones have been completed and by
what.  Really requires the system I am working on now.

Look at what already has been done along these lines.
