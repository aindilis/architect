    <requirement>
      Determine end of REM sleep (in  order to wake user and prompt them
      to record their  dreams.  They have 2 minutes  to record it, since
      after 5 minutes half of it will be lost.)
    </requirement>
    <capability>
      Binaural beat  generation is being experimented with  as a cheaper
      method of  determining when REM  sleep ends, by stimulating  it to
      occur  at certain  times.  Sbagen  has the  capability to  run all
      night  long binaural  beat  programs designed  to stimulate  dream
      phases at certain times.
