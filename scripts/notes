Here is the plan

# First, get the match system script to work using CSO or the CSO database.

Then make a module of it.

search for all internal and external capabilitiy requests, and build the following model:

capability system - status [implemented,not implemented], [requires trial]
	   system - status 
capability system - status

.
.
.

Then trial to see which ones we need to install and review, use radar
to fetch and install into the local archive.

Then distribute them out to people for testing.  Install all
prerequisites.
