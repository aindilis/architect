Given a document, extract  requirements, i.e. states that are expected
to hold about a particular software or greater system.

Given a  set of  requirements, record which  have been  satisfied, and
links to sets of changes that implement those.

All changes  should be recorded  as a dag.  Determining  which changes
affect others is difficult.

This is  also the notion behind backwatcher.   Backwatcher can trouble
shoot installations by manipulating changes.

Knowing how  to add and  remove configuration options is  critical.  A
simple method would  be to just use subversion.   That has the benefit
that certain systems can be restored.

Do an  analysis to determine  whether these requirements exist  in the
capabilities database.

Therefore need to extract capabilities.

Since for  most projects we have limited  capability information, have
to figure out some way to obtain that.

For which system are capabilities important.
